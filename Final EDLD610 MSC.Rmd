###In this project, I model within-task longitudinal physiological data from children ages 3-7 who are part of a clinical trial. All data is simulated and not real. My first two visualizations are primarily for academic audiences, though with different purposes. My final visualization is for a community audience of early childhood clinicians.  
```{r loadData}
#load data using here and rio packages
here() #check directory
d2 <- import(here("data", "synData.csv")) #import simulated data

```

###Summary of use of Synthpop to generate my simulated data
####Do not run
```{r synthpop, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
dsub <- d[, c(1, 2:21, 23, 27, 28)] #select data from original datafile "d"
syn1 <- syn(dsub) #create synthetic dataset based on original data
compare(syn1, dsub) #compare distributions from real and synthetic data
write.syn(syn1, filename = "synthData", filetype = "csv") #write and export synthetic data to csv 

```


###Visualization 1: Academic Audience
####Visualizing Quadratic Trajectories of Child RSA across a task with four conditions from a significant multilevel analysis

```{r final}
p1 <- ggplot(data = d2, aes(x = Time, y = RSA)) +
    geom_line(aes(group = id), color = "gray70", alpha = .5) + #ST added transparency to background lines
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", 
                formula = y ~ x + I(x^2), 
                size = 1, 
                se = FALSE, 
                color = "#20A387FF") + 
    facet_wrap(~W1TCAGEY, nrow = 1) +
    labs(title ="Quadratic Trajectories of RSA by Child Age",
         x = "Condition",
         caption = "WJ-AP = Woodcock Johnson Applied Problems; WJ-PV = Picture Vocabulary; 
                    RSA = Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia") +
    scale_x_continuous(name = "Condition",
                       limits = c(0, 3),
                       labels = c("Resting", "WJ-AP", "WJ-PV", "Recovery")) + 
    theme_minimal() + #ST added to get rid of gray background
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
          panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()) #ST added to get rid of x axis gridlines that don't match a condition
p1

#Looking for feedback on any changes that would reduce cognitive load required from x-axis labels
#ST I would consider changing the labels to time (T1, T2 etc) since it is trajectories, and then in the legend have the tasks associated with the times(T1: Resting...). Another idea is to put them all in 1 column and change the aspect ratio


```

###Visualization 2: For Teaching Purposes with Student Audience in a Multilevel Modeling Course
####Visualizing uncertainty in growth curves as a way to demonstrate between-child variability and uncertainty in slope parameters
```{r animation}
#transform time to numeric 
d2 <- d2 %>%
  mutate(Time = as.numeric(Time))

#first iteration
d2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(Time, RSA)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits =c(0,10 ), breaks= seq(0, 10, by = 1)) +
  ggtitle( "Changes in Child RSA by Task Condition")
```

```{r animation2}
#second iteration
#added jitter to points 
#first iteration

#ST added jitter object to use to decrease overlap of jitter
jitter <- position_jitter(width = 0.3, height = .1)

d2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(Time, RSA)) +
  geom_point(position = jitter, alpha = .6) + #ST added transparency to background points and referenced jitter object
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits =c(0,10 ), 
                     breaks= seq(0, 10, by = 1)) + #ST I have been trying to figure out how to do this - thank you!
  ggtitle( "Changes in Child RSA by Task Condition")

#if reviewers have any suggestions about reducing the amount of jitter, it would be appreciated!
```

```{r animation3}
#third iteration
#add tranparency to show overlapping points and removed jittering
d2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(Time, RSA)) +
  geom_jitter(width = .05, alpha = .5) + #ST changed point to narrow jitter to better see overlap
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits =c(0,10 ), 
                     breaks= seq(0, 10, by = 1)) +
  ggtitle( "Changes in Child RSA by Task Condition")

```

```{r animation4}
#first use boostrapping to model variability 
row_samps <- rerun(100,
      sample(seq_len(nrow(d2)), 
             nrow(d2), 
             replace = TRUE))


#extract samples 
d_samps <- map_df(row_samps, ~d2[., ], .id = "sample")

#plotting both bootstrapped data
boots <- ggplot(d2, aes(Time, RSA)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(aes(group = sample),
              data = d_samps,
              geom = "line",
              color = "#4375D3",
              fullrange = TRUE,
              size = 0.1)
boots


#verify bootstrapped sample and raw data match 
both <- ggplot(d2, aes(Time, RSA)) +
  geom_jitter(width = .05, alpha = .5) + #ST changed point to narrow jitter to better see overlap
  stat_smooth(aes(group = sample),
              data = d_samps,
              geom = "line",
              color = "#4375D3",
              fullrange = TRUE,
              size = 0.1, 
              alpha = .3) + #ST increased alpha
  geom_smooth(color = "magenta") + #ST moved this smooth to the layer after the bootstrapping to better see after increasing alpha
  labs(title = "Changes in Child RSA by Task Condition",
       x = "Condition")
both

#ST the transparency on the final stat smooth is so low that it looks almost like an se ribbon - I would consider changing the aspect ratio or increasing alpha. 
```

###Final animated plot

####I set this to eval = FALSE as I am not able to successfully get it to render.
```{r animate4}

#install.packages("gganimate") install gganimate if needed
#install.packages("gifski") install gifski package to render animation

#ST I removed the eval = FALSE and it rendered perfectly for me!

library(gganimate)
library(gifski)
ggplot(d2, aes(Time, RSA)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .1) +
  stat_smooth(data = filter(d_samps, sample <= 20), # Only animate first 20
              geom = "line",
              color = "#4375D3",
              fullrange = TRUE) +
  transition_states(sample,
                    transition_length = 0.5,
                    state_length = 0.5) +
  ease_aes('linear') +
  labs(title = "Changes in Child RSA by Task Condition",
       x = "Condition")
#ST I would consider adding the jitter here as well

#anim_save(here::here("edled610_msc_final", "data", "RSA_hop.gif")) #trying to save animation
#![](final/RSA_hop.gif)
  
#Reviewers: I am struggling to get my visualization to save as a .gif to animate it. I also need to consider replicability, for example, where do I set the animation to save so anyone could access it?
#ST I don't know anything about saving a gif, sorry. But it did render correctly for me. 
```

###Third Visualization for Community Audience

####Visualizing levels of adversity, as measured by ACE exposure, by child age and gender for hypothetical audience of clinicians who would like to better characterize the population they support. 

```{r third, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 5}
#turn gender into a factor 
d2 <- d2 %>%
  mutate(TCgender = as.factor(TCgender)) 

#creating categorical variable based on Adverse Childhood Life Experiences. I am taking a continuous measure that ranges 0 - 10 and grouping it into "low", "medium", and "high."

d2$category <- cut(d2$PEXCTOT1, 
                   breaks=c(-Inf, 1, 4, Inf), 
                   labels=c("Low","Middle","High"))

# removing NAs from ACE exposure variable 
d2 <- d2 %>%
  filter(category != "na")


#third visualization
viz3 <- ggplot(d2, aes(category)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = TCgender), position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~W1TCAGEY, nrow = 5) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_OkabeIto() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "ACE Exposure in Children by Age and Gender", 
       x = "Level of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)\n", #ST adding space between axis title and axis
       y = "Number of Children")
  
viz3  
  
#ST I would put a caption as to why there are no groups for low in 4-7 and consider putting labels on the ends of your bars for the values. 

```

```{r final3, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 5}
#rename Gender factor levels 
library(plyr)
d2 <- d2 %>%
  mutate(TCgender = as.factor(TCgender)) 


#putting some transparency in bars with alpha; 
viz3 <- ggplot(d2, aes(category)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = TCgender), position = "dodge", alpha = 0.7) +
  facet_wrap(~W1TCAGEY, nrow = 5) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_OkabeIto() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "ACE Exposure in Children by Age and Gender",
       x = "Level of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)",
       y = "Number of Children",
       fill = "Gender") # 1 = boy, 2 = girl
  
viz3  

#need to add fct_reorder
#Consider annotating Gender #ST I wouldnt do this unless you get rid of the facet somehow
#Or, change values of Gender facotr
#d2<- d2 %>%
#  revalue(TCgender, c("1"="boy", "2"="girl"))
#I can't figure out how to get the low category to only reflect one gender when there is a NA value (e.g., for 7-year-olds there are only girls who are in the low ACE category)
  #ST I also tried a few things and couldnt get it to work.
#ST GREAT JOB!
